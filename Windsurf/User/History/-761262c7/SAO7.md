# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and has become one of the most popular choices for modern web development.

## What is React?

React is a component-based library that allows you to build reusable UI components. Each component manages its own state and can be composed to create complex user interfaces.

## Key Concepts

- **Components**: Building blocks of React applications
- **Props**: Data passed between components
- **State**: Internal data management
- **Hooks**: Functions for using React features

## Your First Component

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

This simple component demonstrates the basic structure of a React component.
